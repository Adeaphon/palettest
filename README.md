# Palettester

## What is Palettester

A while ago I was working on a project that generated images, but when it came to writing the unit tests, I was stumped.
It seemed like I was going to have to write more code to write a single test, than I would need to write to generate
the images in the first place. That's where Palettester comes in.

Palettester is a Java library designed to help people test images. It contains a whole suite of functions designed to
make every part of testing images easier. However, it's main purpose is to let you test the color palette being used in
the image.
